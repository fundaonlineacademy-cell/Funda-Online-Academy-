# Funda Online Academy — Protected Approved State

Last established: 17 September 2026 (South Africa time)
Baseline commit: `5a81c946a84b5f9112e831e1e1362fbfc863b853`

This file exists to prevent regressions and the reintroduction of previously corrected or rejected behaviour.

## How to use this file

- Treat the baseline commit above as the current live technical checkpoint.
- A baseline is **not** permission to copy old code from earlier commits.
- Do not restore behaviour from an older commit merely because it previously existed.
- Preserve the decisions below unless Aziwe Futhe explicitly requests a change.
- If a new owner decision supersedes an item below, update this file in the same controlled change.

## Protected current decisions

### Login / authentication

- On mobile/tablet layouts up to 1023px, the login page must keep the established order: **brand panel first, authentication panel second**.
- Staff/Admin access must require normal authentication plus the assigned **Staff Access Code**.
- Staff/Admin role verification must remain enforced; a normal Student account must not gain Staff/Admin access through the staff route.
- Successful Admin login routes to the Admin Command Center; successful Staff login routes to the Staff Workspace.

### Public Courses page

- The public course-result-count summary remains hidden in the approved presentation.
- The approved primary sort presentation is **Most Popular**, not a restored legacy catalogue label.
- The sort control remains left-aligned in the approved presentation.
- Do not reintroduce an older Courses-page layout when working on unrelated functionality.

### Student Dashboard / Student Library typography

- `Source Sans 3` is currently a **limited trial** on the Student Dashboard and Student Library only.
- Do not expand that font system-wide, to Admin, Ambassador, public pages, or other portals without explicit owner approval.
- Do not treat the trial as approval to redesign spacing, sizes, colours, cards, navigation, or other UI.

### Student onboarding / enrolment

The current baseline includes the recent five-step onboarding direction. Preserve it unless specifically asked to change it:

- Five-step onboarding flow.
- Payment separated into Step 4 of 5.
- Onboarding progress/draft persistence and autosave.
- Influencer / Brand Ambassador as an enrolment-source option.
- Official bank-account and beneficiary-verification wording currently in production.
- Enrolment-submission confirmation email hook.
- Public “enrol anytime” messaging and related course FAQ behaviour.

### Ambassador referrals

- Ambassador referral links are intended to lead into account creation/registration rather than bypassing the registration journey.
- Referral attribution must remain separated from Student account privileges.
- Existing referral behaviour must not be silently rewritten while working on Staff/Admin login or public-course content.

## Explicit anti-regression rules

The following patterns are not acceptable unless Aziwe explicitly asks for them:

- Restoring an older page layout because it looks cleaner or is easier to code.
- Reintroducing a control, count, wording, colour, or navigation item that had been intentionally removed or replaced.
- Expanding a trial UI decision to the rest of the academy.
- Replacing an approved working flow with a “newer” or more generic pattern without owner instruction.
- Using an unrelated feature file as the permanent home for another feature.
- Adding a new override script to fight an existing override without first identifying the source conflict.

## Architecture risks already identified — do not worsen them

These are known cleanup targets, not permission to alter them during unrelated tasks:

1. `supabase-config.js` currently acts as a broad global/page-specific script loader and therefore has a large blast radius.
2. `ambassador-referral-tracking.js` currently mixes Ambassador referral logic with Staff/Admin login protection and public-course FAQ loading.
3. Some UI corrections rely on reapplication/timers/observers. These should be consolidated carefully in dedicated cleanup work rather than layered with more overrides.

## Owner decision log

Add future protected decisions here in concise form, with the date and the owner request that established them. Do not remove older entries merely because code was refactored; mark them as superseded only when the owner explicitly changes the decision.

- **2026-09-17:** Protect the approved mobile login order and public Courses-page control presentation from regression.
- **2026-09-17:** Keep the Source Sans 3 change limited to the Student Dashboard and Student Library trial until the owner decides whether to expand it.
- **2026-09-17:** Introduce a strict no-surprise-change protocol: change only what the owner requested and preserve unrelated approved behaviour.
